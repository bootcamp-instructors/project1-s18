# Project 1: Campaign Website

Create a website promoting your favorite FICTIONAL character from a book, TV show, movie, or graphic novel, 
who is running for the elected position of Constable in your magistrate district of Fayette County. (There 
are 3 such districts.)

Briefly research the role of Constable, then design a political website for your chosen character. Here's
a link to get you started:

## Objectives and requirements

To complete the assignment, you must:

1. Create a public repo in your personal Github account.
2. Create an HTML file and a CSS file and add them to your project.
3. Push your code to Github.
4. Deploy your application to Heroku.
5. Post links to your Github repo and Heroku application to the Project 1 Slack channel.

You may use Bootstrap for basic styling.


## Content

Your website should introduce the public to your candidate, explain why he/she/it is running, and list
three issues that are important to him/her/it. 

Your job is to make it easy for voters to see whether your candidate's beliefs align with their own.

To keep things light and fun, pick issues that pertain to the character in their fictional setting, not 
the real world. :-)

Remember to include a prominent picture of your candidate and a call to action - election day is November 6!

    

## Application file structure

Minimally:

```
  app/
    index.html - menu page
    main.css - stylesheet
  docs/
    requirements.md
  README.md
  Procfile
  package.json
```

Make sure there's something to read in your README file.

It's okay if your project has more files, but at the least you need the ones listed above.



## Remember to push to Github!

Your repo should be public so that others can see your code and comment on it.



## Remember to deploy to Heroku!

You will need to follow our example boilerplate to set up an Express server.

You will also need to include a Procfile so Heroku knows how to start your server.



## If you finish early...

Continue to add content and pages to your site and improve the styling.



## If you get stuck...

Ask. :-)
